## Brief

> To be a good typographer you have to care about language.

> Treat text as a user interface.

> Content is necessary to validate the design process and substantiate the final design. Without content as propellant, the design process descends into the creative pussyfooting and disposable prettiness of the factory of garbage, staffed by the pro-celebrity pop stars who peddle their “one-style-fits-all”, recycled typo-illustration, entirely devoid of meaning and content.

app reflect real process that is followed during professional and/or commercial app
development.

> **Abstract**
>
> This paper focuses on a personal brand of a designer. Possible approaches and changes of
any visual content and analysis of suitable channels through designers can communicate
with their audience. At the same time, it points out various advantages and disadvantages.
Resources from such fields as marketing, psychology, research technology and, last but not
least, especially the creative sector, were used for this work. My research shows that social
networks such as Instagram and online creative platforms such as Behance and Dribbble
provide best practices for building a designer brand quickly and properly. Online marketing
is also an excellent opportunity to strengthen any brand and reputation.
>
> Based on the available results, I came to the conclusion that, for example, marketing
opportunities such as the social network Facebook are less suitable than Instagram. And how
important it is to think about your own brand before starting the creative process itself. It is
also important to explore other possible content for future designers who want to build their
personal brand using internet and related networks.
